# AssessMech-Combust
This repository offers an open-source CFD code package and well-structured turbulent flame cases, specifically designed for the development and validation of reduced mechanisms in large-scale turbulent combustion modeling.

The open-source CFD code package utilized here is DeepFlame, a deep learning-empowered open-source platform for reacting flow simulations. It is available at https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepflame-dev.
